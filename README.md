# Python Practice Portfolio

Welcome to my Python Practice Portfolio! This repository showcases my journey in learning Python programming and data analysis through a variety of practical exercises and projects. It demonstrates my growing proficiency in Python core concepts, data structures, JSON handling, and algorithm problem-solving.

## About Me

I am an aspiring Software Developer and Python/Data Analyst enthusiast eager to learn and grow. This portfolio reflects my commitment to mastering programming fundamentals and applying them to real-world problems.

## Repository Structure

- **json_exercise.ipynb**  
  Practical exercises converting Python objects to JSON strings and back, demonstrating serialization and deserialization concepts using the `json` module.

- **Dictionary.ipynb**  
  Exercises and notes on Python dictionaries, exploring manipulations and common use cases.

- **List_Exercise.ipynb**  
  Practice problems and examples focusing on Python lists and list operations.





## Key Skills Demonstrated

- Python basics: data types, variables, control flow  
- Data structures: lists, dictionaries, sets  
- JSON handling with `json.dumps()` and `json.loads()`  
- Algorithm problem solving with LeetCode challenges  

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Praruj/Python-Practice-Portfolio.git

2. Open the Jupyter notebooks to run and explore exercises interactively.

3. Use this portfolio as a reference or inspiration for your own Python learning journey.

## Future Plans
