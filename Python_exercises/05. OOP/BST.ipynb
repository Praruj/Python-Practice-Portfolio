    "# Binary Tree Search Class: \n",
    " a binary search tree also called an ordered or sorted binary tree, a rooted binary tree data structure with the key of each terminal node being greater than all the keys in the respective node`s left subtreee and less than the ones in right subtree. The time complexity of operation on the binary search is directly proportional to height of the tree. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A Binary Search Tree (BST) is like a special kind of upside-down family tree for numbers. Imagine a tree where each \"parent\" number can have up to two \"children\": one on the left and one on the right. The rule is: the left child and all numbers smaller than the parent go on the left side, and the right child and all bigger numbers go on the right side. This way, when we look for a number, we don't have to check every number. You start at the top (root) and decide to go left or right based on whether the number we're looking for is smaller or bigger, making it faster to find things the higher the tree is.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the BST keeps things organized so we can find, add, or remove numbers quickly by following these left and right rules, kind of like a game of \"hot or cold\" guiding we where to go next in the tree."
